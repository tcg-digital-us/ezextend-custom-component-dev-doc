Creating a Custom Dashboard Component
=====================================

This guide explains the process of creating a custom component that would be included in the ezeXtend source code and built into MCube. In the future, we hope to create a system that allows clients and users to create dashboard components without having access to the MCube or ezeXtend source code, but until then, this is the best current solution for adding custom functionality to ezeXtend.

In this guide we will be making a custom Button element.
